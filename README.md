# Scripts
Scripts for Raspberry Pi 

These are some scripts that I use in Linux and on the Raspberry Pi.  The .bash_aliases is a collection of aliases I use to make things easier.  The .conkyrc file is one that I use with conky to display uszeful info on my desktop.

The others are scripts I have gotten from other usrs and modified for my use.
